# Convert Money Project

## Objective:
The **Convert Money** project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for converting currency values between Real Brasileiro (BRL), US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), and Bitcoin (BTC). This web application allows users to input a monetary value in Brazilian Real and obtain its equivalent in the selected target currency.

## Project Structure:
The project consists of the following files:

- **HTML file (index.html):** Defines the structure of the web page.
- **JavaScript file (main.js):** Handles the conversion logic.
- **CSS file (style.css):** Styles the user interface.

## HTML Structure:
The HTML structure is well-organized, utilizing semantic tags and clear labeling. It includes:

- Dropdown menus for selecting the source and target currencies.
- An input field for entering the monetary value.
- A button to trigger the conversion.
- A section displaying the result with currency boxes showing the source and converted values.

## JavaScript Code:
The JavaScript code in `main.js` effectively handles the currency conversion. It uses the `Intl.NumberFormat` object to format and display currency values. The code is concise and readable, making good use of conditional statements to determine the target currency and updating the displayed values accordingly. Additionally, the code includes a function to dynamically change the currency name and image based on the selected target currency.

## CSS Styling:
The CSS file (`style.css`) provides a clean and visually appealing design. It follows best practices by using a combination of custom styles and a Google Fonts import. The responsive design ensures a consistent layout across different devices.

The **Convert Money** project effectively achieves its goal of providing a straightforward currency conversion experience. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, and the user interface is visually appealing.
